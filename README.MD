#  OpenBroadcaster Multimedia Server

## Overview

One OBServer may manage one or more OBPlayers in a synchronized network configuration or have the server and playout on one device or VM.   There is a robust Plugin Module Architecture with many modules extending the core server application.  The server has a documented API to enable sharing digital media assets and metadata with revocable secure keys.

## Installation

To install OBServer, you should have a basic understanding of the Linux shell terminal. Once installed, every aspect of your station is managed via OBServer's web interface.
