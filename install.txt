OpenBroadcaster - OBServer Installation Instructions

These instructions are an alternative to using ob.installer.sh

Note: When using special characters in the password, they need to use single quotes instead of double quotes when they echo the string 

1. See dependencies.txt for server dependencies.  Mostly PHP/MySQL related, but a few things to support transcoding and media identification. 

2. Copy server files to a web environment (web document root).

3. Import db/dbclean.sql to a database.

4. Copy config.sample.php to config.php, Edit as necessary.

5. Ensure media storage directories are writable by the web server.

6. In the web document root, create 'assets' and 'assets/uploads' directories. These directories should be writable by the web server.

   /var/www/observer/tools/cli/ob passwd <username>
